## 1. MaxiTel Call Center Insights Dashboard (2022‚Äì2024)  

An executive-level dashboard providing a **comprehensive, big-picture summary** of the call center's performance.  

**Year-over-Year KPIs**  
- Large, prominent KPI cards at the top of the report use DAX to compare current metrics to the previous year, providing a high-level performance summary.
  
**Call Type Breakdown**  
- üìä Donut chart showing distribution of calls by type.  
- Example: *General Inquiry = 48.06% of all calls*.  

**Historical Trends**  
Two separate combination charts track key metrics over time:
- **AHT vs. Abandoned %** ‚Äì Handling speed vs. lost calls.  
- **AHT vs. Actual/Forecast %** ‚Äì Performance against business goals.  

**Dynamic Storytelling (DAX)**  
A dynamic text box, powered by DAX measures, provides a narrative summary of the data. For example, it automatically calls out:
- Automatically generated insights, e.g.:  
  - ‚Äú01-Jul-23 had the highest AHT: 654 seconds.‚Äù  
  - ‚Äú03-Jul-23 had the highest Abandoned Calls %: 7.2%.‚Äù
